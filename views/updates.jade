        |I spent way too much time on the site this month. I procrastinated a lot on finishing the test stand controller. I have a lot of work ahead of me... The school was able to help me out with the purchase of some parts, including the new Helium regulator. I need to construct the valve mounts and test that, water test the tanks, and have the control board and software done before january. I don't see it happening, but I am going to try!

        |Finished design of valve mounting brackets. Also had two successful water tests. One of them was with just kerosene injector orifices, the second was with both. There is a slight misalignment of the injector pairs, but it should not be detrimental to engine performance.

        |Worked on mounting design and ordered more sensors. I have began to work on my website for new documentation. The valve mount designs are done, but I need to kick into gear and make them. Furthermore, the HS might be able to help me out with the cost for some new parts!

        |Nearly all work this week went to building the new site, which is now on angular. Should be fun!

        |Happy Thanksgiving! I worked on troubleshooting issues with IÂ²C. The Node server is able to send messages and receive 1 byte messages. It still only receives garbage for longer messages. Furthermore, my new spray nozzles came in for the fire suppression rig.

        |My project proposal was accepted and work has begun. The engine and test stand are complete, but I still need to finish plumbing design. Furthermore, The test stand control board needs to be tested. The analog inputs have been left untested. I need to generate I mush more complete parts list for the plumbing so I can have parts for the test scheduled around the beginning of January. I am a little worried about getting this all done in time, so I will be picking up speed on the plumbing and controller. I will be recruiting help on the weekends for assembly. So far, I think I am on track. I just need to get this plumbing done...

        |This week I worked mostly on plumbing. I have created most of me design drawings, but still need to lay out the specific parts I need (valves, fittings, hosing, etc). The Engine and Test Stand are complete while software is mostly done. The rest of the Test Center setup needs to be completed. Most of this is plumbing, but still need to do fire suppression and assemble a test crew. I have a lot of work ahead of me!
